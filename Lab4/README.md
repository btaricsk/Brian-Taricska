In your README.md file, describe - in a few sentences - what we've covered in lesson 4.

Chapter and Lab 4 covered types of lists, dispersion, frequency and variations of distribution. Starting with the 
lists, these are mutable (changeable) collections which are understood how to properly be used in practice. Different methods, including 
pop, reverse and split can be used to modify these lists. Dispersion is the measure of how spread out is the data and can be computed using
the range function to determine the largest and smallest values. Central tendency is an estimation of where the center of the data lies, and 
the mean, median and mode functions show the central tendency in different ways. The standard deviation is an important concept to understanbd
especially when looking at the frequency distribution. My personal takeaway with distribution is distilled down to "change." When determining
the frequency distribution, we're looking for frequency and degree of change.
