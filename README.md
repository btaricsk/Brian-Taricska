Brian's account for scripting fundamentals 

-What are primitive elements? A primitive element in Python is essentially synonymous with an "object" in other programming langauges. Some examples are integer numbers, floating point numbers and complex numbers
-How can we combine primitive elements? The combination of primitive elements is pretty simple. Python understands elements, expressions and how they relate to one another. An example of a combination is in the equation "2+2=4"
-What number is represented by 319e5? "E" for "exponent," so 319e5 = 319 ** 5 or 319 to the fifth power
