Create functions to complete the following: 
2.8 Compute the sum of the first 100 even numbers. Call the function First100EvenSum. 
>>> acc=0

>>> for x in range(1,101):

        acc = (acc/2) + .5n 

>>> acc

2.9 Compute the sum of the first 50 odd numbers. Call the function First50OddSum. 
>>> acc=0

>>> for x in range(0,50):

        acc = (acc/2) + .5n 

>>> acc

2.10 Compute the average of the first 100 odd numbers.  Call the function First100Avg.
>>> acc=0

>>> for x in range(0,100):

        acc = (acc/2) + .5n 

>>> acc
