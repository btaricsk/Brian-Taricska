In chapter 7, we firstly covered data mining which continues with the data analysis trend from previous chapters. Data mining is essentially looking for patterns in large amounts of data and being able to draw intelligence from it. To expand upon data mining, cluster analysis is the graphing of large data which gives more tangibility to the data. And to furth expand upon clusters, k-means is an algorithm based upon clusters;"for" and "while" loops can also be used with k-means. A practical example of the aforementioned data ananlyes is with earthquakes. Earthquake data from around the world can be gathered to make sense about where, when and how often earthquakes will surface.
