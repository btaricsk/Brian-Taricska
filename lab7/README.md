In your README.md file, describe - in a few sentences - what we've covered in lesson 7 / Chapter 8.
In this chapter, we're going to look at crypotanalysis, or the breaking of code. Code can be cracked using something called brute force, which means an attempt to crack the code using all the possibilities and combinations of words found in the dictionary. Various patterns can be found in both the transposition and substitution ciphers which give hackers an advantage to take a calculated attack. The rest of the chapter focuses on the different letters, and their combinations which help pair together phrases that may be used as authentication secrets.
